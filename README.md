# Introduction
Pitney Bowes, a global shipping and mailing company, provides technology, logistics, and financial servicesto small businesses, retailers, enterprises, 
government, and the majority of Fortune 500 companies for simplifying the process of mail and parcel delivery. Since the meters involved the business operation for their clients,
determining prospective equipment failure will prevent the cause of disruption for their clients.

The Baruch Data Challenge with Pitney Bowes required each group to design a mdoel to predict which meters will fail wiihin the next 7 days.

Pitney Bowes provides 2 files:
1. train.csv- Sample data for meters with a flag whether they fail within the next 7 days
2. test.csv- Sample data without fail flag.
